Explain System.out.println() method.

* System class has a static reference variable out of type PrintStream.
* Using the reference variable out we can access the non-static methods of PrintStream Class.

Explanation : 

class System{
	static PrintStream out = new PrintStream();
}

class PrintStream{
	
	void print(){
	
	}
	
	void println(){
	
	}
	
}

* print() and println() are pre-defined example for method overloading.
* hashCode9(), equals(), toString() and compareTo() are pre-defined example for method overriding.
